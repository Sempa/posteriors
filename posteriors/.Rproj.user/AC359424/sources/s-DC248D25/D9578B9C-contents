\title{
Nearest number generating function
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
Generates a vector of nearest numbers on either side of and closest to the target ODn, which is used to generate Likelihood. For every target ODn, the function selects the nearest ODns around the Target ODn.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
}
\usage{
nearest_numbers(value_x, vec_y, to_select)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{value_x}{
  Patient ODn as measurement, after the first HIV positive test.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{vec_y}{
  A vector of ODns from 0.01 to 4 step size 0.01
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{to_select}{
  Number to be selected from of ODns closest of the target ODn, to be selected.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
}
\details{
The function selectes the nearest 6 ODn values (including itself) by calculating the absolute difference between the target ODn and a vector of ODns in vec_y. the input to_slect is the one thatinputs the number of ODn values to be slected from vec_y
